Like to draw? Like to solve jigsaw puzzles? Try JigDraw!

This is an Android app where a user draws something and use it to generate and solve jigsaw puzzles of various difficulties (easy, medium, hard).  I have been slowly adding features and plan to complete and release it at some point.  

I refactor a lot and try to keep my code simple, clean, and well tested.  

I've added a [contributing](https://github.com/julesbond007/Android-Jigsaw-Puzzle/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code style](https://github.com/julesbond007/Android-Jigsaw-Puzzle/blob/master/codeStyle/intellij-java-style.xml) templates so if you have ideas how to improve it, please feel free to send me a pull request.

Thanks for looking!
